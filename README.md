# ModMenu
ModMenu handler for Î”V: Rings of Saturn

# Usage
This repository contains two separate versions of the mod menu: a standalone and internal version. The only difference between the two is the internal version has an additional check for if the standalone version is installed, where it will disable itself to prevent a duplicated button. There currently is no check for other internal mod menu instances yet, so it is recommended to have it installed if more than one mod using the internal modmain until capabilities to check for mod internals has been figured out.
