# NOTICE: THIS MOD HAS ENDED SUPPORT
This mod is no longer supported, and all functions provided by this mod will not be supported unless it was ported to [mod menu 2](https://github.com/rwqfsfasxc100/ModMenu2), or you directly ask me to create a standalone mod. If you have any issues with this, please upgrade and see if the issue persists.

# ModMenu
Mod Menu for Î”V: Rings of Saturn

# Usage
This Mod Menu provides a user interface to display the mods currently installed to the game, information surrounding them including load priority and mod version, as well as stuff that has been provided by the author, and handling for configurations if provided. Mods also have the added ability to provide links to certain resources that they would find useful to the user, such as mod repositories and downloads, a Discord thread for the mod, and other content that is provided. Controllers are fully supported too!
